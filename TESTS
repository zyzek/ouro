Tests.

NOTE: Since any runtime errors, or anything produced by a print statement is done asynchronously,
      these are not detectable by the built-in test harness. Gotta snag the output ourselves
      and do the diff manually.

Errors, warnings, runtime checks.
    The files in test/fails cover this. Runtime failures are demonstrated by the stuff in
    test/fails/ir.
    
    Errors:
        NoMain, FuncUndefined, FuncRedefined, Wrong Func Signature, VarUndefined, VarRedefined,
        PolyAssign, No Return
    Warnings:
        Unreachable After, Unreachable Branch, Redundant Conditional, Infinite Loop
    Runtime:
        Failed Register Lookup, Failed Var Lookup, Bad Args given to Main, Func Wrong Args,
        No Such Function, No Such Block.

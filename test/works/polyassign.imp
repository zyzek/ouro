"
 Multiple assignments evaluate the expressions on the right
 hand side before placing the values in the variables.

 This is not only convenient for condensing several assignments
 down onto a single line, but the RHS can also involve the 
 variables on the LHS. For example we can easily swap two variables
 without having to keep a temporary variable around.

fun one() { 1 }

fun main()
vars a, b, c
{
   a, b, c = one(), (1 + 1), 3;
   b, c = c, b;
	
   (a + b)^c
}

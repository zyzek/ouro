"
 A demonstration of operator precedence.
 Atoms:
   numeric literals
   variable ids
   function calls, including ouroboroi
   ternary operations
   unary operators applied to an expression
   parenthetical expressions

 Some of these atoms may themselves contain expressions
 as sub-components.

 The precedence order is then as follows:
   Unary Operators;
   Exponentiation;
   Multiplication, Division, Modulus;
   Addition and Subtraction;
   Equality and Inequality comparators;
   Logical operators.

fun three()
{
	3
}

fun main()
vars a, b, c
{
	a, b, c = 1, 2, 4;

	!true x| a + -(b - c) - three() * -?(1, 4, 0) ^ (2 * 2 / 4) == --15
}

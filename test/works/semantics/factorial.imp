 Here is a very compact factorial program.
 
 The ouroboros operator, '@' is simply an alias to its enclosing function.
 It looks a little bit like a snake eating its tail, so represents recursion.

 The last expression in a block is returned, if it lacks a semicolon.

 Here we take advantage of short circuiting in |. The right operand is only evaluated if
  the left one is false. Since "true" is represented by 1, the equality operator here returns
  the correct value in the base case, when n is 0.

fun main(n) { n==0 | @(n-1)*n }

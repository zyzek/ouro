 In the case of the linear-recursive factorial program, the while loop was not of much help.
 But here, we can save ourselves an exponential amount of work in computing the Fibonacci numbers,
  versus the recursive version.

fun  main(n)
vars next, curr
{       
    next = 1;

    while (n != 0)
    {
        curr, next = next, curr + next;     
        n -= 1;
    }

    curr
}

 xor is defined in the language as x|

 Here we note a slight difference in the behaviour of the built-in
 xor and the one defined in the function below.

 x| returns the value of its nonzero argument, if exactly one of them 
 evaluates to true.

 The xor function here does not exhibit this value-preserving
 characteristic, but the two are at least logically equivalent.

fun xor(a, b)
{
	(!a & b) | (a & !b)
}

fun main(a, b)
{
    (a x| b) & xor(a, b)
}
